## About Me

I'm **Michael Jian**, a high school student at University High School in Irvine, California. My interests center on using mathematics to understand the world.

This website documents my research projects at various stages, including:

- Summer 2025 - Present: Alzheimer’s disease prediction using baseline and longitudinal MRI. I began this research during a UC COSMOS program.   <a href="{{ '/alzheimers/' | relative_url }}">View project</a>

- Summer 2024 - Present: electric vehicle (EV) adoption across states (2016  - 2023). This project is joint with my friend Jason.   <a href="{{ '/ev/' | relative_url }}">View project</a>

- Summer 2024: Student dropout risk. This is the first data science project I worked on. I completed the project during a two-week machine learning program.   <a href="{{ '/dropout/' | relative_url }}">View project</a>

- MIT Primes participant (2026); accepted to MIT Primes USA 2026 program. Looking forward to working on exciting research.
