## About Me

I'm **Michael Jian**, a high school student at University High School in Irvine, California. My interests include applied mathematics, especially statistics and data-driven research.

This website documents research projects I worked on, involving real-world datasets and statistical modeling, including:

- Summer 2025 - Present: Alzheimer’s disease prediction using baseline and longitudinal MRI. I began this research during a UC COSMOS program.   <a class="button" href="{{ '/alzheimers/' | relative_url }}">View project</a>

- Summer 2024 - Present: electric vehicle (EV) adoption across states (2016  - 2023). This project is joint with my friend Jason.   <a class="button" href="{{ '/ev/' | relative_url }}">View project</a>

- Summer 2024: Student dropout risk. This is the first data science project I worked on. I completed the project during a two-week machine learning program.   <a class="button" href="{{ '/dropout/' | relative_url }}">View project</a>

- **MIT Primes participant 2026**; accepted to MIT Prime's 2026 program. Look forward to working on something cool! To be updated.

## Research Highlights

<div class="card">
  <h3>Alzheimer’s Disease Research (2025 Summer - Present)</h3>
  <p>
    Suring a UC COSMOS program, I modeled Alzheimer’s disease risk using brain imaging and cognitive data. After that, I focus on 
    identifying longitudinal MRI signatures associated with disease progression.

  <h3>Electric Vehicle Adoption Research (2024 Summer - Present)</h3>
  <p>
    I analyzed large-scale government datasets to study trends in electric vehicle adoption and
    identify key drivers of growth over time. This is joint work with my friend Jason.

<div class="card">
  <h3>Student Dropout Risk Modeling (2024 Summer) </h3>
  <p>
    I built predictive models to estimate student dropout risk using demographic, academic,
    and engagement-related features. This work completed when I attended a machine learning summer program at UCI.
