## About Me

Hi! I'm **Your Name**, a researcher interested in *data science, machine learning, and applied statistics*.  
I enjoy exploring real-world datasets, designing experiments, and communicating results clearly.

This site highlights some of the research projects I've worked on, including:

- Alzheimer’s disease prediction
- Electric vehicle (EV) data and adoption
- Student dropout risk modeling

Use the **Research** menu above to explore each project in more detail.
