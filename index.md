## About Me

Hi! I'm **Michael Jian**, a high-schooler attending University High School, Irvine, California.

I really like exploring and solving both abstract math and real-world problems.

This site highlights some of the research projects I've worked on, including:

- Alzheimer’s disease prediction
- Electric vehicle (EV) data and adoption
- Student dropout risk modeling
