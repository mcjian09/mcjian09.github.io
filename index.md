## About Me

I'm **Michael Jian**, a high school student at University High School in Irvine, California. My interests include applied mathematics, especially statistics and data-driven research.

This website documents research projects I worked on, involving real-world datasets and statistical modeling, including:

- Alzheimer’s disease risk and progression modeling  
- Electric vehicle (EV) adoption and growth dynamics  
- Student dropout risk prediction

## Research Highlights

<div class="card">
  <h3>Alzheimer’s Disease Research</h3>
  <p>
    I modeled Alzheimer’s disease risk using brain imaging and cognitive data, with a focus on
    identifying longitudinal patterns associated with disease progression.

  <h3>Electric Vehicle Adoption Research</h3>
  <p>
    I analyzed large-scale government datasets to study trends in electric vehicle adoption and
    identify key drivers of growth over time.

<div class="card">
  <h3>Student Dropout Risk Modeling</h3>
  <p>
    I built predictive models to estimate student dropout risk using demographic, academic,
    and engagement-related features.

## Timeline

- Summer 2025 - present: Alzheimer’s disease prediction using baseline and longitudinal MRI. I began this research during a UC COSMOS program.
- Summer 2024 - present: electric vehicle (EV) adoption across states (2016  - 2023). This project is joint with my friend Jason.
- Summer 2024: Student dropout risk. This is the first data science project I worked on, which got me into the area.
- **MIT Primes participant 2026**; accepted to MIT Prime's 2026 program.
