# Alzheimer’s Research

I started researching Alzheimer's Disease during COSMOS at UCI.

## UCI COSMOS

Throughout the COSMOS program, I and two partners worked on predicting Alzheimer's Disease using Neuroimaging and Cognitive Data. Our presentation poster is below:

## Continuation of Research

During COSMOS, we wanted to do an longitudinal analysis of the data to analyze how changes in the brain over time affected Alzheimer's progression. However, we were unable to sort through the data.

Following the conclusion of COSMOS, I started working on the longitudinal analysis of the data, and presented my work at the [Southern California Conference for Undergraduate Research](https://sccur.org). My slideshow is below:
